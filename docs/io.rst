Importing and Exporting models
==============================

Importing models
----------------

You can import models by selecting the System / Import Model menu, selecting the model type to import, and the model file itself.

You will usually want to stick with the *Model package (.cairis)* option to import .cairis files.  .cairis files are zip archives with a model file, any supplemental locations and architectural pattern models, and all the image files associated with the model.

You can, alternatively, select the *Model file (.xml)* option, which imports a standard CAIRIS XML model file (as defined by the DTD in https://cairis.org/dtd/cairis_model.dtd).  If you select this option, you can choose to overwrite an existing model (the default option) or you can incrementally import the contents of a model file into a pre-existing model.

You can also import other types of model into your current working project.

Exporting models
----------------

.. figure:: ExportModel.jpg
   :alt: export model form

To export a model, select the System / Export Model option.  Exporting the current model renders the current CAIRIS database you are working with as a CAIRIS XML model (conforming to cairis_model.dtd).
You can also export a selected architectural pattern, the security patterns currently loaded into CAIRIS, or a GRL model for a selected environment and task; this GRL can be imported into jUCMNav.
